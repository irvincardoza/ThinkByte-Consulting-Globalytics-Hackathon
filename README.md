# 🌍 Globalytics Hackathon – AIESEC Exchange Growth Strategy (Finalist)

> Empower, Engage, Excel  
> Transforming Exchange, One Journey at a Time.

A finalist-winning project built for the **Globalytics Hackathon**, where we partnered with AIESEC SFU to uncover key bottlenecks in their outbound exchange program. Using over a decade of historical data, we identified critical drop-off points, conducted funnel and faculty engagement analysis, and proposed scalable, data-driven interventions to boost exchange participation.

## 🎯 Executive Summary

We designed the **EEE Framework**:

| 💪 Empower         | 🧠 Engage                     | ⚙️ Excel                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Alumni Ambassador Network | Faculty-targeted outreach      | Streamlined application-to-approval flow |
| Peer mentorship sessions | Department-specific success paths | Pre-application guidance & feedback loop |
| Social storytelling     | Academic & career alignment | 3-week SLA, 50% process simplification    |

📈 **Goal:** Increase realized exchanges by 50% and reduce approval bottlenecks by 30% by 2027.

## 🧠 Core Questions We Tackled

- What factors influence student drop-off at each stage of the exchange funnel?
- Which faculties have the most untapped outbound potential?
- How can ambassador programs, targeted engagement, and application redesign boost conversions?

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- Identified **79%+ attrition** between initial applications and final realization.
- Pinpointed faculty-specific gaps in engagement, especially outside business/social sciences.
- Proposed a 3-stage action framework (EEE) to **improve the exchange pipeline** and reduce drop-offs.
- Built all visualizations using **Python, pandas, matplotlib, plotly**, and domain logic.
